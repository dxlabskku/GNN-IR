# GNN-IR: Examining Graph Neural Networks for Influencer Recommendations in Social Media Marketing
This repository is to supplement the paper "GNN-IR: Examining Graph Neural Networks for Influencer Recommendations in Social Media Marketing".


## Abstract
With the notable growth of the Internet, a number of platforms have emerged and attracted an enormous number of users. Based on the impact of these platforms, some `influencers' are highlighted. These influencers wield significant power, shaping consumer behavior. This influence spawned the concept of influencer marketing, where companies leverage these personalities to advertise their products. YouTube stands out as a prominent platform in this trend. However, considering the limited number of influencers and their concepts, the majority of companies, which hope to conduct their marketing campaigns with influencers face challenges in identifying suitable influencers for their campaigns. With this trend, we introduce GNN-IR, a graph neural network for influencer recommendation, based on the connections between companies and influencers of YouTube, one of the largest content platforms. By utilizing sentimental analysis, meta-information, and image features with GNN-IR, 96.51\% precision (K=1) is achieved. Based on the experimental results, several implications and limitations are presented.

## Dataset
We constructed a sponsorship dataset capturing the relationship between commercial sponsors and YouTube creators sourced from _Ugwanggi_, a platform specifically designed for checking sponsorship advertisement lists on YouTube. Encompassing samples dating from 2016 to September 5th, 2023, the dataset contains details such as the sponsor's name, YouTube creator's name, upload date of videos, sponsor categories, and keywords associated with YouTube creators. In addition, our data collection extended to YouTube to gather more nuanced information about YouTube creators, which includes the number of subscribers, total video count, overall view counts, creators' profile images, and video IDs.
